  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>Others create content for pay, I get paid to create content. The difference? A deep-rooted passion to design and construct engaging deliverables that help your projects become more creative, effective and efficient.</p>

    <p>As a NYC-based, multi-disciplinary content creator working across documentary videography, special effects, and digital photography, I've kindled a reputation for creating warm, content-focused design with a variety of clients </p>

      <p>My designs help businesses look more professional, make greater sales, and organically grow their audiences. During my time as a Video and Content Creator for The Actors Theatre Workshop, my videos increased viewership by almost 80 percent. </p>

        <p>My body of work has been featured in industry publications like the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace & Justice WorldLink Reader, and recognized by institutions such as The George Washington University. In 2019, I was selected to receive the University and Alumni Award. </p>

          <p>By blending innovation, creativity, and an expert eye for photography, I create powerful products that bring your story to life! </p>
